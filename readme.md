# Sjogren syndrome deep learning project
The goal of this project is to correctly classify US images from the parotid glands (PGs) and submandibular glands (SMGs) following the OMERACT scale. This scale is an agreed upon metric designed by experts that quantizes the morphological and structural appearance of the PGs and SMGs.


# Structure of the code
The code is structured as follows ....

We first perform a naive preprocessing that crops the images and retains the areas of interest around the glands. Next, we  After that we perform data augmentation which is a critical step for learning due to the reduced number of images available to us. Training and validation follows

## How to do inference
In order to test the best model with your own images we provide an inference.py function.

# Results 
Here we provide a table of the results for our test set.
